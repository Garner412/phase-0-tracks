One of my biggest flaws is definitely FYWG. Once I start coding I just kinda... go. If something doesn't work I try something else. If would say I am definitely a guess and check type coder at the current moment. Another thing I don't do as well as I could is taking the time to Google some error codes, google some issues I'm having with the code I'm writing. I'm sure I'm not the first one to have the issues that I have and I can probably search for solutions other people have come up with to the common issues.

One thing I will do is start using Git and branches more efficiently. Currently, I just copy and paste the code into a test file and work from there. Once I get the code working properly in that file, I'll copy and paste it into the main file and move on to the next part of the assignment. Another thing I could do better is to take a minute and do some research on the task at hand instead of just plowing forward. I think a more thorough understanding of what is being performed will help get through bugs more efficiently.
