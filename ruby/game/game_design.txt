Pseuodocode for 6.6 Solo Challenge: A Game Class

Release 1: Design A Game

Features of the game:
One user can enter a word (or phrase, if you would like your game to support that), and another user attempts to guess the word.
	In the driver code, prompt user1 to enter a word. That will be set to the word user2 will try to guess. Once set, prompt user2 to begin guessing (need to tell user2 how many letters the word contains and the number of guesses they will be alotted.)

Guesses are limited, and the number of guesses available is related to the length of the word.
	A loop that compares the number of guesses to the length of the word. Need to set a loop counter that adds to the count every failed guess.

Repeated guesses do not count against the user.
	Need to store the guesses, if the guess is already in the array we'll be storing them in, do not add to the count or add it to the array (possible some type of unique method?)

The guessing player receives continual feedback on the current state of the word. 
So if the secret word is "unicorn", the user will start out seeing something like "_ _ _ _ _ _ _", which would become "_ _ _ c _ _ _" after the user enters a guess of "c".
	

The user should get a congratulatory message if they win, and a taunting message if they lose.
