// Create a function that acts on a string in the manner that str.reverse does in Ruby
// To create a reverse of a string we need to take the character at the last index of the inputted string and add it as the first character of a new variable.
// We then need to work backwards until we reach the 0 index of the string adding each variable to the end of the new variable.
// We can then return the new variable as our new reversed string.
