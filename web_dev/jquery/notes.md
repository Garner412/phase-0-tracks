How to tackle and learn as much JQuery in two hours as possible.

I will start by Googling JQuery basics. 
	-this will give me an idea of why we use JQuery and what benefits it provides

Then I will will looks for a tutorial, whichever appears to provide the most value
	-video
	-book

	-I'll use this to get a quick and dirty introduction

I will then find an interactive way to work with it. 
	-exercises (maybe along with video or book)
	-something like Codecademy

	-this will allow me to actually work with the information I'm learning.

I'll work on learning JQuery utilizing the Pomodoro Technique
	-25 minutes learning
	-5 minute breaks

	-this will allow me to take a break and reflect on what I'm learning


I started by using Google to search for JQuery basics / background / why it's used, etc.
I learned a good bit about how it's a library within JS that helps to accomplish more things in a lot less lines of code. 

I then started looking for a video or book and came across W3Schools. I've learned a lot from W3 so I scrapped my plan to just sit and watch videos or read a book and actually use an interactive learning style.
