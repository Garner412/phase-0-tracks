# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	Version control is the ability to record changes to a file so you can return to previous versions if need be. It is a way to manage your code. If a bug occurs in your code, you can revert to a previous version that worked properly while you resolve the issue.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	A branch is a copy of some code that you can work on to make changes without impacting the master code. You would use it to test new changes without impacting the main code.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	Commit is a way to save your changes in the repository. A good commit message details specifically what was changed. 
* What is a merge conflict?
	Merge conflict is when two branches have changed the same part of the same file and have been merged together. Git doesn't know which version to accept.
